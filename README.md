This is a repository for my new Unsupervised Learning AI code that you could use.
I just uploaded the frist release code, use and enjoy it but don't forget to star.
I will be releasing the final and the best version of it I think tommorow or so that is just going to blow up, so don't forget to star!

Also, all of the explanation and the mathematics and ..... will be uploaded soon, therefore you could just understand the algorythm so much better.
